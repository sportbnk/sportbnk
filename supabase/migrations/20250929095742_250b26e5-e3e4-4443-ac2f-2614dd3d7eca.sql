-- Ensure teams table has shared access policies for all authenticated users
-- (This should already be in place, but confirming the correct structure)

-- The teams table should already have these policies, but let's ensure they're correct:
-- 1. Admins can manage teams (already exists)
-- 2. Authenticated users can view all teams (already exists)  
-- 3. Authenticated users can create teams (already exists)
-- 4. Authenticated users can update teams (already exists)
-- 5. Authenticated users can delete teams (already exists)

-- No changes needed - teams table already has correct shared access policies
